# What Is Prime Perform
Prime Perform is a modern performance-support supplement category designed for consumers seeking general wellness, vitality, lifestyle enhancement, and day-to-day performance. Many shoppers compare it to products like Prime Labs testosterone booster or Carolina Prime Performance when evaluating ingredient profiles. Unlike traditional blends, Prime Perform formulas emphasize adaptogens, botanical extracts, and performance-focused ingredients for active adults seeking non-medical support. It is unrelated to a prima donna's performance, despite the linguistic similarity occasionally causing confusion over keywords.
The broader category includes variations such as prime performance male supplements, prime performance horse supplements, prime performance equine supplements, and prime performance supplements, each tailored to different audiences. Whether formulated for humans or animals, such as prime performance horses, these products follow different manufacturing standards and should never be interchanged.
